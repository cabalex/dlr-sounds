# dlr-sounds
 A spiritual successor of [SoundsOfDisneyland.com](http://soundsofdisneyland.com). This version might not work right now (mixed content and CORS and the like... will probably have to host it separately), so I'm working on that.

## Why?
[SoundsOfDisneyland.com](http://soundsofdisneyland.com) is a great website that hosts over 1000 high quality versions of the tracks found in the California theme parks. However, the site can be buggy/slow, and I've found it often fails to load tracks in many cases. This rewrite aims to fix this, adding:
- Ability to search titles and albums
- Cleaner UI with support for dark/light mode
- Snappier animations
- Media controls
- Creating custom playlists (coming soon)

This was just a fun hobby project of mine, in an attempt to rewrite one of my favorite music sites. I don't own any of the audio or images!
