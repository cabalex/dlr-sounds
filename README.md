## Why?
[SoundsOfDisneyland.com](http://soundsofdisneyland.com) is a great website that hosts over 1000 high quality versions of the tracks found in the California theme parks. However, the site can be buggy/slow, and I've found it often fails to load tracks in many cases. This rewrite aims to fix this, adding:
- Ability to search titles and albums
- Optimized audio and image assets for faster loading (.mp3 -> .ogg, .png -> .jpeg)
- Cleaner UI with support for dark/light mode
- Ability to be added to the home screen
- Full screen playback mode
- Snappier animations
- Media controls integration (PC/Android only)
- Ability to create custom playlists

## Credits

This was just a fun hobby project of mine, in an attempt to rewrite one of my favorite music sites. I don't take credit for any of the audio or images!
