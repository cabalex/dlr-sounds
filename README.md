# [dlr-sounds](https://cabalex.github.io/dlr-sounds)
 A spiritual successor of [SoundsOfDisneyland.com](http://soundsofdisneyland.com).

## Why?
[SoundsOfDisneyland.com](http://soundsofdisneyland.com) is a great website that hosts over 1000 high quality versions of the tracks found in the California theme parks. However, the site can be buggy/slow, and I've found it often fails to load tracks in many cases. This rewrite aims to fix this, adding:
- Ability to search titles and albums
- Optimized audio and image assets for faster loading (.mp3 -> .ogg, .png -> .jpeg)
- Cleaner UI with support for dark/light mode
- Snappier animations
- Media controls integration
- Ability to create custom playlists

This was just a fun hobby project of mine, in an attempt to rewrite one of my favorite music sites. I don't own any of the audio or images!
