 A spiritual successor of [SoundsOfDisneyland.com](http://soundsofdisneyland.com).

## Why?
[SoundsOfDisneyland.com](http://soundsofdisneyland.com) is a great website that hosts over 1000 high quality versions of the tracks found in the California theme parks. However, the site can be buggy/slow, and I've found it often fails to load tracks in many cases. This rewrite aims to fix this, including:
- Album/Track search
- Optimized audio and image assets
- Cleaner UI with support for dark/light mode
- PWA compatibility (add to home screen)
- Full screen playback (click the album art!)
- Snappier animations
- Media controls integration

Plus, some entirely new features, such as:

- Immersion mode: uses reverb and audio effects to sound like you're in the park
- Creating custom playlists
- Viewing track names and timestamps for select music loops

This was just a fun hobby project of mine, in an attempt to rewrite one of my favorite music sites. I don't take credit for any of the audio or images!
